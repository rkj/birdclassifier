USAGE
*****
No parameters
=============
Program run without any parameters starts with GUI.  After loading sound file
you can start analysing it.  Green fragments in signal panels are those that
have energy higher than threshold set in 'Signal energy' panel.  You can select
fragments in 'Audio signal' panel using left mouse button.  Clicking LMB on
green fragments in 'Digitally filtered signal' selects it for analysis -
'Spectrogram' panels show results of FFT and normalization process.  Clicking
MMB on selected fragment in 'Audio signal' panel also selects it for analysis.
Using RMB on 'Audio signal' panel zooms in or out the view.

Using parameters
================
When parameters are given then program runs in batch mode and process subsequent
files printing recognition result on console.
Parameters description:
	-h
		Display help.
	-nofilter 
		Do not apply filter to loaded files. It is bandpass filter on 2kHz-14kHz.
	-snr value
		Set 'Signal To Noise Ratio' on value. Default 3.0. Used to check if
		there are any data in signal or only noise on all frequencies. Check
		Audio.cpp file.
	-cutoff value
		Set difference cutoff threshold to value in percent. Default 0.255. If two
		samples differs more then they cannot be threated as voices of the same
		type.
	-powerCutoff value
		Set signal power threshold. Default 1e-04. Audio signals below the threshold
		are not analysed. Used for splitting audio signal on small fragments.
	-hopeTime value
		Set hopetime to value seconds. Default 0. Used in splitting audio signal. In
		this process signal above power threshold is selected as single voice. But
		sometimes there is short quiet in the middle of voice. This parameter set to
		some low value helps to better cut single voices.
	-verbose
		Turn vebose mode on.
	-nounknown
		Turn reporing of unrecognized voices off.
	-save prefix
		Save analysed samples in prefixXXXXXXXXXX files, where Xs are successive
		numbers.
	-saveLearning prefix
		Save learning samples in prefixXXXXXXXXXX files and to learning-all.freq.
	-learning dirName
		Read learning set from files in dirName.
	-learnFile fileName
		Read learning set from fileName.
	-crosstest
		Performs 10-fold cross validation on learning set instead of analysing
		files.
